# Escape From Tarkov: The Unheard Edition
## Discord Theme

### Informations

This is theme **INSPIRED** by new Escape From Tarkov's edition - The Unheard Edition - which comes with new main menu design.

#### Theme Completion

Currently is theme about 80% completed. There are some things that needs to be fixed and/or made like:
- emoji, gifs, stickers menu
- add reaction menu
- some elements in discord settings
- some elements in server settings
- soundboard, stream menu
- some modal boxes

I'm not aiming to do theme perfectly 100% complete. If i was trying to, it would consume too much time spending on parts of discord, that users don't use regularly and so it is not priority.

As well, Discord is releasing updates that **can** break this theme.
